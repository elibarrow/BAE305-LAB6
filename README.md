## Summary of Lab ##


### Lab Objectives: ###
1. Familiarize ourselves with the use of an ultrasonic sensor in a distance measuring
application.   
2. Understand the use of the Motor Driver and program an algorithm to control the
movement of two motors.
3. Develop a program to prevent your robot from colliding with an object in front of it.   


## Lab Assignment Specific Items ##


## Methods and Testing ##
### Part 1 - Learn to Listen ###
We began this part of the lab by connecting our RedBoard to the computer and starting up the Arduino IDE application on our computer.  
After this step we then connected the ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 to the circuit shown below.

We then programmed an algorithm to read the distance from the sensor to a clear box, and send the value to the serial communications display in the Arduino IDE application. The code for that step is shown below.
